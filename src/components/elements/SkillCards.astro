      While I have a strong affinity for Data Science (using tools like pandas, scikit-learn, torch), 
      a significant part of my professional journey has involved collaborating on infrastructure projects 
      (ranging from Docker to AWS and Azure) and data engineering (including Spark & Palantir Foundry)

      My experience in product development and consulting, along with project exposure to senior
      management has enhanced my collaborative skills and emphasized the value of clear communication,
      teamwork and shared objectives in product development and consulting.
