Unlock the full potential of AI, customize ChatGPT to your unique writing style. Whether it's for emails, content creation, or casual conversations, the website generate a prompt to adapt ChatGPT's responses to match your tone, style, and personality nuances.

I launched [FindYourChat.ai](https://findyourchat.ai) to help me get a more personal style from ChatGPT. The website allows to easily create, customize and save your unique writing styles. and use them with ChatGPT, Gemini or other places like https://huggingface.co/chat/.

## How does it work?

Through a quiz, you will create your own writing style

And after 10 questions, you will get your personal prompt matching your personality:
