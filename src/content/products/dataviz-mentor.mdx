Following the launch of the GPT Store, I've been exploring the potential of GPTs. I'm happy to share that I am releasing my first GPT called "DataViz Mentor", a new module now available for free to all ChatGPT Plus subscribers (not yet accessible to other ChatGPT users).

### DataViz Mentor

Creating quality data visualizations often requires significant time and expertise. DataViz Mentor aims to simplify this process:

 * It acts as an assistant or “mentor”
 * Offers immediate feedback on your visualizations
 * Guides you towards enhancements.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={datavizMentorOverview} alt="DataViz Mentor Overview" height="400px" style={{ marginBottom: '30px', marginTop: '30px' }} />
</div>

Simply upload an image of your plot and receive prioritized recommendations for improvement.

### How It Works

The recommendations are derived from my work compiling books, blog posts, and other resources into a methodology for assessing data visualisations. I've gathered and summarised common mistakes as well as providing recommendations to fix them. The system uses them for its assessments.

Using GPT vision ability, the system is then able to combine its knowledge with the uploaded image to provide guided recommendations.

I'll share more about creating and publishing your own GPTs in a next blog post.

### Real-World Applications and Case Studies

To evaluate the system, let's see if it aligns with some of The Economist's suggestions. In a Medium blog post, journalist Sarah Leo from The Economist discusses some past mistakes they've made.

[https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368)

#### Example #1: Recommend splitting the chart into 2

Here's an example from The Economist:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={theEconomistChart1} alt="A chart comparison from the economist displaying a combination of bar and line chart" height="400px" style={{ marginBottom: '30px', marginTop: '30px' }} />
</div>

Here are DataViz Mentor's recommendations on the first (left) plot:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={datavizMentorChart1} alt="Recommendations from dataviz mentor to split the visualization into bar and line chart" height="400px" style={{ marginBottom: '30px', marginTop: '30px' }} />
</div>

The mentor agrees with The Economist and suggests using two separate visualizations, among other changes.

#### Example #2: Recommend reworking the axes

Here's another example from The Economist:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={theEconomistChart2} alt="A chart comparison from the economist displaying 2 line with different y axes" height="400px" style={{ marginBottom: '30px', marginTop: '30px' }} />
</div>

Similarly, here are DataViz Mentor's recommendations on the first (left) plot:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={datavizMentorChart2} alt="Recommendations from dataviz mentor to rework the y axis" height="400px" style={{ marginBottom: '30px', marginTop: '30px' }} />
</div>


It points out the misleading y-axis and suggests alterations, along with subtle changes in color and font size, matching the recommendations.

### Improvements and Future Plans?

The current version is only a first step and I have plans to improve it:

- it doesn't guide you on implementing changes in your plotting software or framework, but this is an important direction for next steps.
- While the system generally offers solid recommendations, it might occasionally miss or misunderstand certain plot elements.

In any case, I happy to get your feedback and impressions which will help me refine it. Also, if you're interested in data visualization or GPTs, feel free to reach out and connect.
