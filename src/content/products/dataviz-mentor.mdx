[DataViz Mentor](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-rk1495Cu2-dataviz-mentor)is a GPT to help you make better data visualization. It now available for free to all ChatGPT Plus subscribers.

## DataViz Mentor

Creating quality data visualizations often requires significant time and expertise. DataViz Mentor aims to simplify this process. It acts as an assistant or “mentor” offering immediate feedback on your visualizations. It guides you with prioritized improvements that can be done to any data visualization or plot.

To use it:

1. Upload an image of your plot
2. Receive prioritized recommendations for improvement

## How It Works

The recommendations are derived from my work compiling books, blog posts, and other resources into a methodology for assessing data visualisations. I've gathered and summarised common mistakes as well as providing recommendations to fix them. The system uses them for its assessments.

Using GPT vision ability, the system is then able to combine its knowledge with the uploaded image to provide guided recommendations.
