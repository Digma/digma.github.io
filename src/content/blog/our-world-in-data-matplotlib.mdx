In this series, we aim to transform matplotlib and seaborn plots into engaging data visualizations. We draw inspiration from leading data journalism platforms and online data-driven websites, such as The Economist, The Guardian, and other distinguished sources.

Today, we will focus on [**OurWorldInData**](https://ourworldindata.org/), a platform that provides comprehensive and accessible data on global development. OurWorldInData is known for its clean and impactful visual style, which we aim to replicate in our matplotlib visualizations.

In this article, we will reproduce using **matplotlib** a [Line Chart showcasing Global Greenhouse Gas emissions by sector](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-by-sector):

Let's get to work üßë‚Äçüíª

## Loading the data with Matplotlib

Matplotlib default charts are functional but not always engaging. They often lack visual appeal and can easily distract a non-technical user. After having loaded the [data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-emissions-by-sector) with pandas (code [here](https://gist.github.com/Digma/b91db287f8f577fae41c406892d46b15#file-ourworldindata_ghg_pandas-py)). Here is the default matplotlib line chart for our dataset:

<Image src={MatplotlibBaseLineChart} alt="Base Matplotlib line chart using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="400px"/>

That is maybe functional but we have a lot of work to do to make our plot look like OurWorldInData. Let's start by breaking down the key elements and the steps we need to take to replicate them:

1. **Headings and sources**: The original figure contains various elements that give context to the plot such as the title, subtitle, and sources. We will need to add these elements to our plot.
2. **Chart Axes**: The original figure has a clean and minimalistic look. It has removed various elements and made extensive use of grey to minimize distractions.
3. **Data Series**: Each data series is plotted with a unique color and annotations at the end of each line offer direct identification of each series, eliminating the need for a separate legend.

Let's see how we can achieve these elements in our plot with matplotlib.

### Improvement #1: Enhancing Headings and Sources

To replicate the detailed context provided by OurWorldInData, we start by adding a title, subtitle, and source information to our matplotlib plot. Although this can be also be done using the text and suptitle functions, we use `fig.text` for precise positioning and styling.

```python
# Shades of gray
GREY10 = "#1a1a1a"
GREY30 = "#4d4d4d"
GREY40 = "#666666"
GREY75 = "#bfbfbf"
GREY91 = "#e8e8e8"

fig.text(
    0.015, 0.93, # (x,y) coordinates
    "Greenhouse gas emissions by sector, World",
    color=GREY40, fontname="Georgia", # Serif font
    fontsize=24, weight="bold"
)

# Subtitle
fig.text(
    0.015, 0.90, # (x,y) coordinates
    "Greenhouse gas emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon"
    " dioxide-equivalents over a 100-year timescale.",
    color=GREY30, fontsize=12,
)

# Legend
fig.text(
    0.015, 0.04, # (x,y) coordinates
    "Data source: Climate Watch (2023)\n"
    "OurWorldInData.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions | CC BY",
    fontsize=10, color=GREY30
)
```

Which generates the following plot:

<Image src={MatplotlibHeaderChart} alt="Matplotlib line chart with headers modified using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="400px"/>


In matplotlib, the placement of the text is tedious and requires trial and error to ensure that the elements are aligned and spaced correctly. Make sure you have the right plot size before starting to place the text.

### Improvement #2: Customizing Chart Axes

To achieve the minimalistic look of the OurWorldInData chart, we'll modify the axes of our matplotlib plot. This includes many settings such as background color, hiding specific spines, and using grey for grid lines and tick labels:

```python
# Manually set axes range
ax.set_xlabel("")
ax.set_xlim(1990, 2020)
ax.set_ylim(0, 16)

# Keep only the bottom axis
ax.spines["left"].set_color("none")
ax.spines["right"].set_color("none")
ax.spines["top"].set_color("none")

# X-axis: Change colors axis and label
ax.spines['bottom'].set_color(GREY40)
ax.tick_params(axis='x', colors=GREY40)
ax.xaxis.label.set_color(GREY40)

# X-Axis: Position ticks center, except for first and last
for tick in ax.xaxis.get_major_ticks():
    tick.label1.set_horizontalalignment('center')

ax.xaxis.majorTicks[0].label1.set_horizontalalignment('left')
ax.xaxis.majorTicks[6].label1.set_horizontalalignment('right')

# Y-axis: Add vertical gridlines every 2 billion tons
for h in HLINES:
    ax.axhline(h, color=GREY91, lw=1, zorder=0, linestyle="--")

# Y-Axis: Remove y ticks
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(width=0)

# Y-axis: Change y axis labels to have Unit#
ax.set_yticklabels(
    [f"{y} billion t" if y!=0 else "0 t" for y in np.arange(0, 16, 2)], 
    fontsize=12,
    weight=500,
    color=GREY40
)
```

Which generates the following plot:

<Image src={MatplotlibAxesChart} alt="Matplotlib line chart with axes modified using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="400px"/>

Notice the following:

* On the x-axis, the labels do not extend beyond the axis limits. This is achieved by modifying the alignment for the first and last label
* The different greys minimize distractions, ensuring that attention remains focused on the crucial elements of the plot.


### Improvement #3: Highlighting Data Series

Finally, we will replicate the line plots and annotations in the OurWorldInData. To do that, we will create the line plot and add the annotations and arrow for each series.

```python
# OurWorldInData color palette
COLOR_SCALE = [
    "#6D3E91", "#C05917", "#58AC8C", "#286BBB", "#883039", "#BC8E5A", "#00295B", "#C15065", 
    "#18470F", "#9A5129", "#E56E5A", "#A2559C", "#38AABA", "#578145", "#970046", "#00847E", 
    "#B13507", "#4C6A9C", "#CF0A66", "#00875E", "#B16214", "#8C4569", "#3B8E1D", "#D73C50"
]

# Remove existing legend
ax.legend().remove()

# Define margin around annotation
PAD = 0.1

# For each timeserie
for idx, column in enumerate(df_grouped.columns):
    # 1. Pick a Color from OurWorldInData palette
    color = COLOR_SCALE[idx]
    
    # 2. Plot each line with some round markers
    ax.plot(
        df_grouped.index, df_grouped[column], 
        color = color, label=column, marker="o", 
        markersize=2.5, lw=1.2, clip_on=False
    )

    # 3. Add annotation with name of each serie 
    y_end_value = df_grouped[column].iloc[-1]
    annotation_x = 2021
    annotation_y = y_end_value
    ax.text(
        annotation_x, annotation_y + y_offset, column, 
        color=color, fontsize=12, va="center"
    )

    # 4. Add arrow between line to annotation
    line_chart_x_end = 2020 + PAD
    line_chart_y_end = y_end_value
    ax.arrow(
        line_chart_x_end,line_chart_y_end,
        1-2*PAD, 0,
        clip_on = False, color=GREY75
    )
```

Resulting in the following plot:

<Image src={MatplotlibLineChart} alt="Matplotlib line chart with lines and annotations modified using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="400px"/>

Please note the use of `clip_on=False` in the plot method to ensure that the lines extend beyond the axis limits, allowing the arrows to be placed at the end of each line. It is also used to prevent matplotlib from clipping the rounded markers at the start and end of each line.

We are getting very close to the OurWorldInData line chart. However, we still have some work to do to make our plot look like the original:

* One issue with matplotlib is that it does not provide a straightforward way to add non-overlapping annotations to the end of each line. To address this, we can implement a custom function that adjusts the position of the annotation for each line.

### Improvement #4: Avoid overlapping annotations

For now, we will fix the overlapping manually by adjusting the y position manually and adjust the arrow and annotation. I will look into sharing code to automate it in the future but, for now, that will do:

```python
y_offsets = [-0.1, 0.05, 0.3, -0.4, 0, 0, +0.1, 0, +0.4, -0.2, -0.1]
...
# 3. Add annotation with name of each serie 
y_end_value = df_grouped[column].iloc[-1]
y_offset = y_offsets[idx]
annotation_x = 2021
annotation_y = y_end_value + y_offset # Add Offset
ax.text(
    annotation_x, annotation_y + y_offset, column, 
    color=color, fontsize=12, va="center"
)

# 4. Add arrow between line to annotation
line_chart_x_end = 2020 + PAD
line_chart_y_end = y_end_value
ax.arrow(
    line_chart_x_end,line_chart_y_end,
    1-2*PAD, y_offset, # Add offset
    clip_on = False, color=GREY75
)
```

which generates our final plot:

<Image src={MatplotlibFinalChart} alt="Final Matplotlib line chart with our fixes using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="500px"/>

## Results and learnings

While the result is not perfect, we did get pretty close:

<Image src={BeforeAfterResultChart} alt="Final Matplotlib line chart with our fixes using Our World In Data Greenhouse gas emissions by sector dataset" height="400px"/>

Unfortunately I find, that it requires significant efforts. It is not always easy to navigate the matplotlib API and options. While the library is quite powerful, it can be challenging to achieve the desired visual style. In the next months, I will continue exploring how to make that easier, so follow or reach out to me if you are interested in this topic.
